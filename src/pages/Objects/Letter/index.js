                        >I was so confused what to do for your birthday. I decided to write a letter for you, but 
                        when I started writing it, I realized I need to do something better as you deserve great things in life.
                        I want to write things about us and how my life has changed since we met; however, I do not want to take
                        your day and make it about us. So, I will only say a few things. <br/><br/>
                        In the past 6 months, we have learnt a lot about each other. I still remember the day when we first met in Guelph.
                        I was so nervous because that was my first time meeting a stranger. It's engraved in my mind when I was looking for you in the parking lot, and you snuck behind me.
                        In that moment, I did not know what to say, and I am happy I did not say anything foolish; otherwise, I wouldn't have found such a 
                        pefect girl. I do not know how you have been bearing me as I know sometimes, day in-day out, you easily get irritated and mad because of the things I do.
                        Sometimes you get mad even if I do not do anything and that is funny to me, like yesterday I was making this site for you and needed some time,
                        but you got mad ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Thanks to you that I get to explore things. You have filled both the places in my life, a friend and a lovely partner. 
                        I hope we stay the same and keep exploring new things to do.<br/><br/>

                        There is one thing that I will never forget. I was alone for almost 2.5 years and I was sure that I will be stuck
                        in my past forever, but you came along. You made my eyes sparkle for the first time in past 2.5 years. I knew right during our first meeting that you 
                        and I were going to be more than just 2 strangers. I remember that awkward bye when we first met. I was so ecstatic, adrenaline rushing through veins, I forgot how and what 
                        to say once a date was over.<br/><br/>

                        I do not know what happened that made me reinstall Dil Mil and text you, but I am glad I did.

                        Sorry for making it about me but I just wanted to let you know how you changed everything. <br/><br/>
                        Happy Birthday Gurman! I wish we spend your next thousand birthdays together. I love <span id="iLove" onClick={changeILoveText}>{iLove}</span>.
